Format args according to the format string fmt with appended '\n' (which means that each output ends with a new-line), and print the result to a stream.

1)

```sy4
std::println(stdout, fmt, std::forward<Args>(args)...)
```

2)

| std::print(stream, "\{\}\n", std::format(fmt, std::forward\<Args\>(args)...)); | (until C++26) |
| --- | --- |
|std::print(stream, std::runtime_format(std::string(fmt.get()) + '\n'),           std::forward\<Args\>(args)...) | (since C++26)|

3)

```sy4
std::println(stdout)
```

4)

```
std::print(stream, "\n")
```

If std::formatter\<Ti, char\> does not meet the BasicFormatter requirements for any Ti in Args (as required by std::make_format_args), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

| stream | - | output file stream to write to |
| --- | --- | --- |
|fmt | - | an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of
 ordinary characters (except \{ and \}), which are copied unchanged to the output,
 escape sequences \{\{ and \}\}, which are replaced with \{ and \} respectively in the output, and
 replacement fields.

Each replacement field has the following format:

 \{ arg-id (optional) \}

 (1)

 \{ arg-id (optional) : format-spec \}

 (2)

1) replacement field without a format specification
2) replacement field with a format specification

 arg-id

 -

 specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order.
The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error.

 format-spec

 -

 the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with \}.

 For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification.
 For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification.

 For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification.
 For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification.
 For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification.
 For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed.

(since C++23)

 For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification.

(since C++26)

 For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations. |  | \{ arg-id (optional) \} | (1) |  |  | \{ arg-id (optional) : format-spec \} | (2) |  |  | arg-id | - | specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order.

### Exceptions

### Notes

Although overloads (3,4) are added in C++26, all known implementations make them available in C++23 mode.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|__cpp_lib_print | 202207L | (C++23) | Formatted output|
|202403L | (C++26) | Unbuffered formatted output[1]|
|__cpp_lib_format | 202207L | (C++23) | Exposing std::basic_format_string|

### Example

```cpp
#include <print>
 
int main()
{
    // Each call to std::println ends with new-line
    std::println("Please"); // overload (1)
    std::println("enter"); // (1)
 
    std::print("pass");
    std::print("word");
 
    std::println(); // (3); valid since C++26; same effect as std::print("\n"); 
}
```

Output:

```text
Please
enter
password
```
